# SongBook2
A rehash of the PickHacks 2021 SongBook project using Flask.  
This app was made in less than 24 hours by a dedicated team of 4 with zero experience using Flask.  
It is a simple project, but we are very proud of our teamwork and the result.  
Thank you, and we hope you enjoy this fun little toy!

## How to Run
1. Please download the source code and unzip its contents.
1. This is a Flask app, so [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/installation/) must be installed on the system in order to run it.
   1. Flask can be installed via elevated command line using this command: ```$ pip install Flask```
1. This app uses the [Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.19.0/#installation) library package, so that must also be installed
   1. Spotipy can also be installed using a pip command: ```$ pip install spotipy```
1. Once everything is installed, use the command line to navigate to the root directory of the project folder.
1. Run the command: ```$ py app.py```
1. Flask is now running a mock server on a local host; look for the address and port number
   1. It will most likely be this address: ```http://127.0.0.1:5000/```
1. Using a browser, navigate to said address. Now you're using SongBook!
